What an EHRs is:

```sh
An EHR or Electronic Health Record is a digital version of a patient`s medical history containing all the information about the patient, such as their diagnoses, medications, allergies, lab results, and treatment plans. It is designed to store, manage and share patient health information securely and efficiently among different healthcare providers involved in the patient`s care
```
The benefits of using EHRs in healthcare
```sh
    EHR (Electronic Health Record) is a digital version of patients` medical records that contains all patient information, including medical history, medication, treatment plans, immunization dates, allergies, radiology images, and laboratory test results.
    The use of EHR offers many benefits to healthcare providers such as higher care quality, increased patient safety, improved workflows and productivity, better communication between healthcare providers, and more efficient management of medical data.

Historical context for how EHRs have evolved over time
```sh
Electronic health records (EHRs) have come a long way since being first developed in the 1960s. In the early days, EHR systems were rudimentary and lacked standardization, which led to poor adoption rates. However, over time, advancements in technology and regulatory requirements have driven the evolution and widespread adoption of EHRs. Today, EHRs are essential for healthcare providers, offering numerous benefits such as improved patient care, interoperability, and data analytics capabilities.

Why EHR training is necessary and who needs it
```sh
With the growing adoption of Electronic Health Records (EHR) in healthcare, it has become essential for healthcare providers to undergo EHR training. Proper training ensures that all the staff involved in patient care have a good understanding of how to use the EHR system accurately and effectively.
EHR training provides education and helps in developing skill sets that are necessary for managing patient records electronically. EHR training benefits all individuals involved in the healthcare industry, including doctors, nurses, pharmacists, medical billing specialists, administrators, and medical assistants. Regardless of the level of experience or specialization, everyone must go through EHR training to gain familiarity with these systems.

### EHR Functions and Features
- The essential functions of EHRs (e.g., patient registration, clinical documentation, e-prescribing, lab results)
- Describe some primary features of EHRs (e.g., security, data sharing, interoperability)
- Highlight some popular EHR systems currently in use by healthcare providers

The essential functions of EHRs

```sh
Patient Registration: Collecting and storing patient demographics, contact information, insurance details, and medical history.

Clinical Documentation: Recording clinical notes such as physician assessment, treatment plans, lab results, imaging reports, medications administered, and other pertinent health data.

E-prescribing: Electronically creating and processing medication orders - this feature helps to reduce medication errors and streamline the prescribing process.

Lab Results Management: Allowing healthcare providers to receive and document lab test results and track changes over time.

Order Entry/Management: Creating orders for tests, imaging procedures, or additional services, along with tracking their progress to ensure accurate and rapid delivery.

Clinical Decision Support (CDS): Providing real-time advice based on patients` diagnostic tests, clinical alerts, and warnings about potential drug interactions.

Patient Portal: A secure online platform that allows patients to access their medical records, schedule appointments, receive educational materials, and communicate securely with their healthcare providers.

Reporting & Analytics: Generating customizable financial and operational reports to evaluate the impact of EHR usage on revenue, cost, productivity, patient outcomes, and quality of care.

EHRs may include some or all of these functions in order to improve clinical workflow efficiency, increase interoperability between systems, reduce medical errors, enhance patient safety, and improve patient outcomes.

Primary features of EHRs

```sh
1. Security: One of the primary features of an EHR system is security. It helps protect patient data from unauthorized access and ensures that their sensitive information remains confidential.

2. Data Sharing: EHR systems enable healthcare providers to easily share patientsâ€™ health records with other healthcare providers authorized to access the data to ensure continuity of care for the patient.

3. Interoperability: EHR systems have been designed to work with other healthcare software solutions and systems. This feature allows data exchange between different systems or applications to improve care coordination and efficient care delivery.

4. Clinical Documentation: EHRs allow clinicians to create, update and store patient charts electronically. As a result, it reduces the need for paper documents, and the storage of physical files which may take up more space.

5. e-Prescribing: This feature in the EHR system helps clinicians send accurate electronic prescriptions to pharmacies, reducing errors and ensuring fast access to necessary medication.

6. Lab Results management: EHRs help manage lab results more efficiently by directly receiving them from the lab, automating workflow processes or notifications and streamlining the follow-up on abnormal results.

Overall, these features contribute to more efficient documentation (including all patient interactions such as visit notes, progress notes, orders, tests, results, etc.) and improved communication among clinicians as well as increased patient engagement and satisfaction.
